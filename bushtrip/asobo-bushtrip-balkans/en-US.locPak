      "Balkans.Mission.175": "Welcome to the Balkans - your tour begins in Croatia, the 'land of a thousand islands', as you depart from Rijeka Airport and head southeast toward the coastline of Vinodolski Kanal. In the distance, look for a nearly land-locked small bay, Zaljev Soline -- then head past it, to the hook-like bay and small coastal town of Silo.",
      "Balkans.Mission.176": "Carry on travelling south down the coastline. Follow the heading towards a gap between two large hills some miles in the distance.",
      "Balkans.Mission.177": "A road leads southwest away from Vrbnik. Follow the roadway to an intersection just before the waters of Puntarska Draga Harbor. The adjoining highway -- State Road D102 -- is the main route on the island of Krk. Follow it southeast toward a gap between two large hills.",
      "Balkans.Mission.178": "Track along with State Road D102, heading southeast. After a short distance, it will bring you to the resort settlement of Baska, a cultural and historical center situated on the bay Bascanska Draga.",
      "Balkans.Mission.179": "From the bay, follow the rocky shoreline southeast. When you reach the shore's end, make your way across the waters of Velebitski Kanal, gaining altitude as you go. Soon, you'll arrive at Senj, a small bayside town on the upper Adriatic coast, in the foothills of the Mala Kapela and Velebit mountains.",
      "Balkans.Mission.18": "Jadova River Bridge",
      "Balkans.Mission.180": "As you pass over Senj, look for State Road D23 carving a path up a slope in the cliffside. Let it lead you into Senjska Draga, a deep green valley enclosed by the ridges of Velika Kapela and Velebit.",
      "Balkans.Mission.181": "After following D23 for a stretch, look for a major highway interchange for the A1 motorway at Zuta Lokva.",
      "Balkans.Mission.182": "Head southeast from the interchange, as the A1 motorway tunnels through hills and eventually leads you to the Gacka River. Just east of the river, on the perimeter of a karst field, lies the town of Otočac.",
      "Balkans.Mission.183": "Running southeast out of Otočac, look for State Road D50 to lead you past dense patches of forest, toward a grass airstrip on the eastern side. This is Zracna luca Otočac, the first stop on your Balkan journey.",
      "Balkans.Mission.184": "Otocac Airport to Zadar Airport",
      "Balkans.Mission.185": "Once in the air above Otočac, continue southeast along State Road D50. You'll pass back over the Gacka River before reaching a fork in the road. Follow the southern branch, as the road paths into the hills and past an expansive mining operation.",
      "Balkans.Mission.186": "You will soon cross paths with the A1 motorway again. Follow the highway to an interchange a short distance south, near the village of Konjsko Brdo.",
      "Balkans.Mission.187": "Heading south, you will quickly come to a point where the A1 is bridged by a smaller state road running southwest, toward the village of Licki Osik. Continue farther south.",
      "Balkans.Mission.188": "As you follow the road to the south, it will begin to curve and bend toward the east. Let it take you past a forest, to a bridge over the Jadova River, then farther southeast.",
      "Balkans.Mission.189": "After a short while following the road, you'll find yourself passing over a rest stop at Odmoriste Zir. Carry on heading southeast.",
      "Balkans.Mission.19": "Odmorište Zir",
      "Balkans.Mission.190": "Start gaining altitude as you continue along the road. You will come to pass two highway interchanges before the road disappears into the Sveti Rok Tunnel, surrounded by dense forestry atop the Velebit mountains. Adjust and turn southwest before heading up, and over, the mountainside.",
      "Balkans.Mission.191": "Once you've crested the Velebit peak, find the road again as it leads toward a bridge over the strait, Novsko Zdrilo.",
      "Balkans.Mission.192": "From the bridge, the road will lead southwest along the shore of Novigradsko More. Continuing farther inland, you'll break away from the road toward an airport in the distance -- Zracna Luka Zadar, also known as your next stopping point.",
      "Balkans.Mission.193": "Zadar Airport to Zracna Luka Split Airport",
      "Balkans.Mission.194": "Depart from Zadar Airport, heading southeast, and quickly you will notice a road running in the same direction. Follow it and eventually you will pass over a highway interchange, reuniting with the A1 motorway near the town of Benkovac.",
      "Balkans.Mission.195": "Continue southeast along the road. After a while, watch for the waters of the Guduca River sluicing under the road and running southwest. Adjust your heading to follow the river.",
      "Balkans.Mission.196": "Continue southeast along the road. After a while, watch for the waters of the Guduca River sluicing under the road and running southwest, towards a lake in the distance -- Prokljansko Jezero.",
      "Balkans.Mission.197": "At the banks of Prokljansko Jezero, make your way down its western shoreline, over the village of Raslina. You'll soon find the inlet for another river, Krka, running southwest. Follow it a short distance, to a marina at the historic city of Sibenik, the oldest native Croatian town on the shores of the sea.",
      "Balkans.Mission.198": "From the marina at Sibenik, you should already be within eyeshot of Morinje Bay to the southeast. Make your way to this new lagoon.",
      "Balkans.Mission.199": "Head southeast, following the heading, toward the Adriatic Sea and a bay near the famous Bedem Grebastica, site of The Wall of Ostrica built in 1497.",
      "Balkans.Mission.20": "Sveti Rok",
      "Balkans.Mission.200": "A road runs straight from the bay, heading east past the tourist village of Grebastica. Follow it through the valley and towards the hills. On the northern hill bank, you should soon see the small village of Blizna Gornja surrounded by trees.",
      "Balkans.Mission.201": "From the tree-lined Blizna Gornja, look for a road running southeast, parallel with the hillside. After a short distance, this road will reach a junction point and hand you off to another State Road, D58, running south.",
      "Balkans.Mission.202": "Turn and follow D58 south, past the village of Seget Gornji, and eventually toward the bay of Seget Donji.",
      "Balkans.Mission.203": "Head southwest over the hills, past the patches of dense forest scattered across the peaks and crevices -- and eventually you will arrive at another runway where you can land, Zracna Luka Split.",
      "Balkans.Mission.204": "Zracna Luka Split Airport to Sinj Airfield",
      "Balkans.Mission.205": "Take flight from Split Airport and head east, along the coastline of Kastelanski Zaljev. You will soon arrive at a small marina near the town of Kastel Gomilica.",
      "Balkans.Mission.206": "Take flight from Split Airport and head east, along the coastline of Kastelanski Zaljev, past the peninsula town of Vranjic, nicknamed 'Little Venice' because of its sheer beauty. Watch for an inlet on the coast, where the Jadro River feeds into a bay by a train yard.",
      "Balkans.Mission.207": "Follow the State Road D1 leading northeast into the mountains as it loops its way past the remains of medieval Klis Fortress and through the mountain pass. Eventually, it will lead you north to a large round-about.",
      "Balkans.Mission.208": "Stay with the road as it curves around the hillside ahead. Let it lead you north through an open green plain before twisting its way around more hills and pathing toward the large town of Sinj. Situated on a fertile karstic field in the area known as Cestinska Krajina, this is your next stop. Look for a grass airstrip on the eastern outskirts of town.",
      "Balkans.Mission.209": "Sinj Airfield to Mostar Airport",
      "Balkans.Mission.21": "Novsko Ždrilo",
      "Balkans.Mission.210": "As you take off from Sinj Airfield, set your sights east. You'll pass over the Cetina River running out, and just beyond it, find the village of Otok with a crossroads at its center.",
      "Balkans.Mission.211": "As you take off from Sinj Airfield, set your sights southeast. Cross the waters of Cetina River, before crossing the tributary of the Cetina, the Ruda River. Head a short distance further southeast to an asphalt triangle where the road meets larger State Road D220.",
      "Balkans.Mission.212": "From the roadway triangle, head southeast along D220. Pass over tracts of housing into the hills and soon you will come to a fork in the road, near a pocket of forestry and the roadside village of Donja Tijarica. Take the southern fork, following the smaller road.",
      "Balkans.Mission.213": "From the roadway triangle, head southeast along D220, and soon you will pass the small hamlet of Tarabnik. Continue in the same direction and you'll quickly come to another village, Gornja Tijarica.",
      "Balkans.Mission.214": "As the road starts bending farther northeast, it will eventually come to a fork. Take the eastern route. Soon you will see the road bend back on itself near the village of Arzano -- but you should continue heading east, over the valley ahead, and pick up a small road running directly toward the mountains. Follow it to the small, sparse village of Velika Vinica.",
      "Balkans.Mission.215": "Just south of the Velika Vinica is a larger intersection, with roads leading southeast and southwest. Follow the southeastern path a short distance, and soon you will see a lake off in the distance, beyond a cluster of hills. Break from the road and head for the hills, making your way toward the lake.",
      "Balkans.Mission.216": "Just south of the Velika Vinica is a larger intersection, with roads leading southeast and southwest. Follow the southeastern path a short distance and you should soon see the glistening waters of Ricice. Make your way over the lake, heading toward the canyon on the southeastern shoreline.",
      "Balkans.Mission.217": "Follow the road running into the hills as it paths southeast, past the sinkhole of Crveno Jezero, also known as 'Red Lake', and the nearby 'Blue Lake' called Modro Jezero. After a short time flying southeast, look for the hillside town of Imotski, situated on the Biokovo Massif.",
      "Balkans.Mission.218": "Running southeast from Imotski, track the route past roadside communities and across the agricultural plain. Eventually, the road will lead you to another town, Grude.",
      "Balkans.Mission.219": "When you reach the town of Grude, turn and head northeast to crest the neighboring hill. Once you've cleared the ridge, look for the village of Kocerin at the foot of another hillside and make your way there.",
      "Balkans.Mission.22": "Zadar Airport",
      "Balkans.Mission.220": "Adjust east from Grude, and follow the heading across the hills. It will take you across the Ugrovaca River to the next town, Siroki Brijeg.",
      "Balkans.Mission.221": "Track with the road as it meanders past several small villages, toward the hillside settlement of Polog.",
      "Balkans.Mission.222": "Continue along the road and it will quickly lead you into the major city of Mostar, named after the medieval guards who kept watch over the Old Bridge that spans the Neretva River. Find the river as you skirt around the mountains on the city's southern side, and follow the waters toward your next destination: Mostar International Airport.",
      "Balkans.Mission.223": "Mostar Airport to Dubrovnik Airport",
      "Balkans.Mission.224": "Departing from Mostar, follow the Neretva River south. In time, you will arrive over the riverside town of Capljina, an archaeological wonder dating back to 5 BC, where two bridges cross the waterway near its center.",
      "Balkans.Mission.225": "Make your way to the rolling hills just east of the Neretva riverbank. Watch for a road running southeast over the hills toward a small lake -- and just beyond it, the Hutovo Blato nature reserve, a complex of marshes, lakes, underground karstic wellsprings and rivers.",
      "Balkans.Mission.226": "Make your way to the rolling hills just east of the Neretva riverbank. A road runs southeast toward the Hutovo Blato nature reserve, a complex of marshes, lakes, underground karstic wellsprings and rivers. Just south of it lies the large semi-artificial Svitavsko Lake. Make your way across it, aiming for the southern shore, and proceed past it to a multi-road junction near the village of Gornje Hrasno.",
      "Balkans.Mission.227": "At the junction, look for the road leading south toward a gap between two mountains, Kapavica and Nin, both carpeted with forest brush. Keep on this path until the road you're following merges with another. As it bends southeast, it will take you past villages and ruins, and eventually to Jezero Vrutak reservoir almost hidden in the hills.",
      "Balkans.Mission.228": "From the southern bank of the reservoir, find Trebisnjica Canal running away toward the east. Follow it, gaining altitude, until the channel loops north -- at which point you will break off and turn southeast, following a road that cuts through the village of Trncina and up the hillside ahead.",
      "Balkans.Mission.229": "The road from Trncina runs southeast to another town, Ravno, which in turn has a road running south over the mountainside. When that path arrives at the entrance to a tree-lined canyon, it bends back north -- but you will turn and head southwest.",
      "Balkans.Mission.23": "Highway Interchange",
      "Balkans.Mission.230": "As you track southwest away from the tree-lined canyon, follow the contours of the pass all the way through. Your course will lead you down a hillside toward the village of Slano, namesake of the area's bay and harbor.",
      "Balkans.Mission.231": "Head southeast down the coastline from Slano Bay. After a short while, you'll find the opening to another bay at the sea town of Zaton.",
      "Balkans.Mission.232": "Head southeast down the coastline from Slano Bay and soon you will reach another bay alongside the Lapad Peninsula. This is the shipping port of Gruz, and entryway to the prominent city of Dubrovnik.",
      "Balkans.Mission.233": "Fly over Dubrovnik proper, then a bit farther southeast to reach the coast. Tracking with the shoreline, you'll pass the small island of Otok Lokrum, cross the waters of Zupski Zaljev bay, and eventually make your way to the town and harbor of Cavtat.T he Dubrovnik Airport awaits just beyond.",
      "Balkans.Mission.234": "A short distance inland from Cavtat harbor, Dubrovnik Airport awaits.",
      "Balkans.Mission.235": "Dubrovnik Airport to Tivat Airport",
      "Balkans.Mission.236": "In the air above Dubrovnik, set your sights southeast and find State Road D8, the Adriatic Highway. After a brief stretch, the road will lead you to the small village of Gruda.",
      "Balkans.Mission.237": "Continuing in the same direction, you will soon end up in Igalo, a small town on the coast overlooking Hercegnovski Zaliv bay in Montenegro.",
      "Balkans.Mission.238": "Carry on southeast, down the rugged, densely populated coast, toward a marina in the distance.",
      "Balkans.Mission.239": "A straight shot southeast from the marina, across the waters of Tivatski Zaliv, make your way toward the seaside town of Tivat on the other side, and the international airport on the coast.",
      "Balkans.Mission.24": "Gudaca River Bridge",
      "Balkans.Mission.240": "Tivat Airport to Tirana Airport",
      "Balkans.Mission.241": "From Tivat Airport, a road leads southeast and into the surrounding hills. Head over the dense forest lining the mountain, and follow the road down to the beach.",
      "Balkans.Mission.242": "Once again, track southeast down the coastline. Make your way past Sveti Nikola Island ahead, past Buljarica Beach and stretches of rocky shoreline, toward another thick forest by a steep cliffside.",
      "Balkans.Mission.243": "Make your way over the trees and low mountain peaks. Head past the rugged terrain of Black Cape on the coastline, and you'll soon find yourself at a large seaside town of Sutomore.",
      "Balkans.Mission.244": "Head past the rugged terrain of Black Cape on the coastline, and you'll soon find yourself at a large seaside town of Sutomore. Fly southeast from it and past Spicanski Zaliv bay. Down the shore, a short distance away, you'll find another marina near the dense city of Bar.",
      "Balkans.Mission.245": "A road runs southeast out of Bar into the mountainside. Follow it while gaining altitude. In time, the road will run farther south, taking you through the coastal suburban town of Dubrava.",
      "Balkans.Mission.246": "Make your way east from Dubrava, across the mountainside. Look for a road heading the same direction, guiding you toward a large peak that stands out along the ridge -- Rasovac. A riverbed runs down the western side of the peak before skirting around its base and heading southeast. Follow the riverbed.",
      "Balkans.Mission.247": "Make your way east from Dubrava, across the mountainside. The riverbed, belonging to Medurecka Rijeka, will lead you southeast to the western shore of Sasko Jezero -- also known as Shas Lake.",
      "Balkans.Mission.248": "Across the waters of Shas Lake, just beyond its eastern shore, you will find the wide flow of the Bojana River curling its way south. Follow the river.",
      "Balkans.Mission.249": "Across the waters of Shas Lake, just beyond its eastern shore, you will find the wide flow of the Bojana River curling its way south. Follow the river toward the coast, past a fork, to point where the Bojana opens up to Adriatic Sea.",
      "Balkans.Mission.25": "Prokljansko Jezero",
      "Balkans.Mission.250": "Head east a short distance down the coast, and you will soon pass a Liqeni i Vilunit, a lagoon situated amidst nature reserves at the foot of mountain peaks.",
      "Balkans.Mission.251": "Head east a short distance down the coast, and you will soon pass a Liqeni i Vilunit, a lagoon situated amidst nature reserves at the foot of mountain peaks. Continuing southeast down the shore, you'll pass a rocky cliffside on your way toward the coastal town of Shengjin and its neighboring lagoon.",
      "Balkans.Mission.252": "From Shengjin Lagoon, fly southeast heading inland. You should quickly cross the waterway of Lumi Drin, as you pick up a road heading your same direction. Follow the road farther southeast, toward the wider flow of the Mat River.",
      "Balkans.Mission.253": "The road carries on south past the river, expanding into a major highway. It will lead you toward the town of Fushe Mamurras, situated near the reservoir Liqeni i Thumanes.",
      "Balkans.Mission.254": "Continue south over the reservoir and the village of Thumane, past various strips of farmland and settlements. The flow of another river, the Gjole, will track parallel to your path, as you close in on the town of Rinas, and the Tirana International Airport where you can touch down.",
      "Balkans.Mission.255": "Tirana Airport to Aeroporti i Mifoit",
      "Balkans.Mission.256": "Once in the air, continue following the highway to the east of the airport. It will cross the waters of Tirane River and bring you to the outskirts of Tirana, the capital and largest city of the Republic of Albania.",
      "Balkans.Mission.257": "Once in the air, continue following the highway to the east of the airport towards the outskirts of Tirana, the capital and largest city of the Republic of Albania. You should soon be in view of the waters of Liqeni i Tiranes, and beyond it the thick forestry of the Grand Park of Tirana. Head for the lake.",
      "Balkans.Mission.258": "Join up with the road again just south of the lake, and follow it southeast. As you pass by hillsides densely covered in trees to the west, look for a highway interchange near the village of Mullet -- and flowing east from here, the river Lumi Erzenit.",
      "Balkans.Mission.259": "As you pass by hillsides densely covered in trees to the west, look for a highway interchange near the village of Mullet and flowing east from here, the river Lumi Erzenit. After following the river a short distance, it will bend toward the northeast -- but you should continue heading south into the hills.",
      "Balkans.Mission.26": "Mandalina",
      "Balkans.Mission.260": "As you draw closer to the hills, the highway below will disappear into a tunnel. Head over the hilly rise to find where the road reappears on the other side. Stay with the descending path as the waters of the Kushja River run parallel to the asphalt, and eventually cross under it near the village of Kozan.",
      "Balkans.Mission.261": "Head south, following the Kushja River. It will lead you past a major industrial park near the city of Elbasan, onto the banks of the wider Shkumbini River.",
      "Balkans.Mission.262": "Adjust your heading and follow the Shkumbini River west. Soon, you will arrive at a fork -- and you should take the westernmost branch.",
      "Balkans.Mission.263": "Continue along the westernmost branch of the Shkumbini, and eventually you'll pass the village of Cengelas on the western banks of the river.",

      "Balkans.Mission.303": "Continue south from Palairos to the end of the shoreline. Your path will bring you toward a mountain on the coast -- skirt around the mountainside and head east. Watch for a jagged outcropping that juts into the ocean, home to the small coastal town and port of Mytikas.",

Continue farther, past homes and businesses scattered along the shore, toward another prominent point, Cape Mavrovuni.",
      "Balkans.Mission.336": "From Cape Mavrovuni, adjust and turn south east. In the distance, off the coast, is a long, jagged island with a mountain ridge running from north to south.

After a short distance, you will arrive on the shores of Syros, and aim for the most northwestern point of the island.",
      "Balkans.Mission.341": "Arc your way around the curved northern coastline of Syros. When you reach the eastern side of the island, turn and head south down the shore toward the town of Ermoupoli, capital of the island and of the Cyclades region.

Make your way toward the northern coast of the largest island.",
      "Balkans.Mission.355": "You should arrive over relatively flat coastline, this is the island of Santorini. Follow it around to the south east. Around half way down the eastern coast of the island is your final airport. Not a bad place to finish up after a long coastal tour!",
