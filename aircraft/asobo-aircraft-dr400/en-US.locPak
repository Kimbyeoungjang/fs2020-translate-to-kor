      "AIRCRAFT.DESCRIPTION": "The DR400\/100 Cadet is the product of Robin Aircraft, a French aviation company that's changed names and ownership multiple times since its origin in 1957 -- yet throughout the years, one thing has always remained: a dedication to handcrafted quality.<\/br><\/br>Introduced in 1972 and still in production, the DR400 is a single-engine four-seat sport monoplane, widely recognized as one of the most famous General Aviation planes across Europe.<\/br><\/br>Part of the model's claim to fame is its predominantly wooden construction. With a fuselage skinned in high-grade grains, and wood-ribbed wing structures draped in aircraft fabric, the DR400 boasts remarkable stability, quiet operation and low drag compared to metal planes riddled with rivets and joints. However, itâ€™s the characteristic 'cranked wing' configuration that makes the line visually stunning, and distinctly unforgettable.<\/br><\/br>Rounding out the package, the DR400 is easy to fly at any speed, with excellent visibility through its forward-sliding glass canopy; no wonder it's a favorite at flight schools, and a staple of French Air Force training and patrol fleets.",
