      "TakeOff.Dlg_ApproachPath1_MALE": "Alright -- no cross-traffic to contend with. You're clear to taxi.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_ApproachPath2": "The rudder pedals should make steering the plane pretty easy.",

      "TakeOff.Dlg_Intro1_MALE": "No matter how many hours I've logged, take off still puts a smile on my face.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Intro2": "Taking-off isn't hard, but there are a few key points to remember.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Intro2_MALE": "Taking-off is not especially difficult -- if you remember a few basic principles.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Intro3": "First, we always take off into the wind… which won't be an issue on a calm day like today.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Intro3_MALE": "First, whenever possible, take off into the wind. This won't be an issue on a calm day like today.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Intro4": "Second, before we enter a runway, we always make sure it's clear. ",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Intro4Reminder": "Check that the runway is clear.",

      "TakeOff.Dlg_PullUp2": "Line up the top of your instrument panel so it's a couple inches above the horizon. That'll pitch us up and set a good climb attitude.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_PullUp2_1": "Keep the cockpit board aligned above the horizon.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_PullUp2_MALE": "Align the top of your instrument panel a couple inches above the horizon. Pitch up and set a good Climb Attitude.",

      "TakeOff.Dlg_Reach5600ft3_MALE": "Step one: adjusting your Attitude.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Reach5600ft4": "We're in a Cruise Attitude, pushing max power. To stay level at our target Altitude, let's start by easing the Throttle back to 1800 RPMs. ",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Reach5600ft4Reminder": "Lower RPMs to 1800 while maintaining 5500 feet.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Reach5600ft4Reminder_MALE": "Lower RPMs to 1800 while maintaining 5500 feet.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Reach5600ft4_MALE": "The aircraft is currently in a Cruise Attitude. You're pushing max power. To stay level, you'll want to ease back the Throttle, to say... 1,800 RPMs. ",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Reach60kts1": "Good. Now, gently pull back on the Yoke…",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_Reach60kts1_MALE": "Good. Now pull back gently on the Yoke.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel1": "You probably noticed, to maintain altitude you need to pitch the nose up.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel1_MALE": "As you may have noticed, to hold this Altitude you need to pitch the nose up.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel2": "You could just keep pulling on the yoke to hold steady. But that's not really a precise means of control…",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel2_MALE": "You could maintain pressure on the Yoke to hold steady. However, that's not exactly a precise method of control… ",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel3": "Probably better to adjust your trim wheel until you don't need to push or pull on the Yoke. Drag the trim down when you need to set the nose up, drag it up to set the nose down.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel3_MALE": "The optimal approach is to adjust your trim wheel until you no longer need to push or pull on the Yoke. Drag the trim down when you need to set the nose up, drag it up to set the nose down.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel4": "Try adding trim to keep us at 5500 feet, without increasing throttle.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel4_MALE": "Add trim to keep the aircraft at 5,500 feet, without increasing Throttle.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel5": "If you feel our pitch slipping and need to get back to the proper attitude, don't worry. Just pull on the yoke then dial-in the right trim.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel5Reminder": "Add trim to stabilize your attitude.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel5Reminder_MALE": "Add trim to stabilize your attitude.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_StraightLevel5_MALE": "If you feel your pitch slipping and need to get back to the proper Attitude, just pull on the Yoke then dial-in the right trim.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_TrimUp1": "The way I was taught, when you adjust the trim, you make rough changes at first to remove pressure on the yoke, then small adjustments to find the perfect setting to keep your desired attitude.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_TrimUp1_MALE": "In my experience, when you adjust the trim, you want to make initial rough changes to remove pressure on the Yoke. After that, you make small adjustments to find the perfect setting to keep your desired Attitude.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_TrimUp2": "That's the key to straight and level flight.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_TrimUp2_MALE": "Understanding trim is fundamental to straight and level flight.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_TrimUp3": "It saves you from constantly pushing or pulling on the yoke…",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_TrimUp3_MALE": "It saves you from applying constant pressure on the Yoke…",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_TrimUp4": "And that gives you more time to enjoy the ride.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_TrimUp4_MALE": "It saves you from applying constant pressure on the Yoke…",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_TrimUp5": "If you want more practice using the trim, go for it. Whenever you're ready to pass the controls, I'll be here.",

      "TakeOff.Dlg_UnexpectedLanding1_MALE": "Alright… Not quite where you were supposed to land.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_UnexpectedLanding2": "It's well done, don't get me wrong… just not what was expected.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_UnexpectedLanding2_MALE": "It's not the end of the world, just unexpected.",
      "TakeOff.Dlg_UnexpectedLanding3": "At this point I think it's probably best if we start the lesson over.",
