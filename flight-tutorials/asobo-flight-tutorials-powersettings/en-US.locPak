      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3": "I still remember my first instructor saying 'the Yoke is like a steering wheel… almost.' Sure you can turn, but you can also pitch.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3_1": "For starters, it controls the Ailerons.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3_1_MALE": "Let's start with turns, though.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3_2": "And the Ailerons, they allow the plane to roll and bank into turns.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3_2_MALE": "The Yoke controls the Ailerons, which control aircraft roll and allow you to bank into turns.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3_MALE": "Some people compare the Yoke to a steering wheel -- and while you can turn with it, you can also pitch.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll4": "Go ahead and try rolling to the right.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll4Reminder": "Don't be afraid. Try banking to the right.",

      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight1": "Good.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight1_MALE": "Alright…",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight2": "Of course, the yoke also controls the Elevator.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight2_1": "And the Elevator affects the plane's pitch, right?",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight2_1_MALE": "The Yoke also controls your aircraft's Elevator, pitching you down if you push forward on the stick, up if you pull back.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight2_MALE": "Now let's talk about Pitch.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight3": "Pull back on the stick, the plane starts to climb. Give it a shot.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight3Reminder": "Pull gently on the stick to climb.",
