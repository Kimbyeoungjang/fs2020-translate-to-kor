      "BasicControls.Dlg_Intro1": "I've got to say, you chose a great day to go flying...",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Intro1_Alt1": "Check out those open skies. You chose a great day to go flying... I'm your training instructor, Captain Molina -- but you can call me Jess.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Intro1_Alt2": "Welcome to flight training. I'm your instructor, Captain Molina… but you can just call me Jess.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Intro1_MALE": "Welcome to the skies above Sedona. Hell of a view, isn't it...?",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Intro1_MALE_Alt1": "Welcome to flight training. I'll be your instructor, Captain Mike Barnes. Are you ready to fly?",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Intro2": "This session we'll get started with some basic controls, sound good?",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Intro2_MALE": "Let's begin our time together going over some basic controls…",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_OufOfBound": "You've left the Training airspace, you need to go back.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_OufOfBound_MALE": "You've crossed out of the Training zone. Better get back in there.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneNoThrottle1": "There you go. Speed is increasing, and as long as we maintain the same Attitude, our Altitude will keep climbing too.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneNoThrottle1_MALE": "Just like that your speed is increasing. And as long as you maintain the same Attitude, your Altitude will keep climbing as well.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneNoThrottle3": "You're really getting the hang of these controls.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneNoThrottle3_MALE": "There's no such thing as a natural-born pilot -- but you're already off to a strong start.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneNoThrottle4": "Before long you won't even need a Co-Pilot.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneNoThrottle4_MALE": "The more you fly, the more these flight controls will become second nature.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneNoThrottle5": "You can pass me the controls when you're ready to finish your session. Or keep flying -- it is a great day after all.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneNoThrottle5Reminder": "When you're ready, you can pass the controls to me.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneNoThrottle5Reminder_MALE": "When you're ready, you can pass the controls to me.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneNoThrottle5_MALE": "Pass the controls whenever you're ready. Or keep on flying… and I'll keep enjoying the view.",

      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneNoThrottle6_MALE": "Until then… If you need help with the aircraft -- radio, checklists, you name it -- I'll be here.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchDown": "Or, for now, let's just pitch down.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchDown1": "Just like that, your speed's picking up again as the nose pitches down.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchDown1_MALE": "There it is, speed is picking up again.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchDownReminder": "Go on, pitch down.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchDownReminder_MALE": "Go on, pitch down.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchDown_MALE": "Instead, for now, just pitch back down.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchUp1": "The most valuable things in aviation are speed and altitude.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchUp1_MALE": "Ask any pilot and they'll tell you: aviation is all about speed and altitude.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchUp2": "But notice when you're pitching up, your speed is decreasing.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchUp2_MALE": "Notice when you're pitched up, climbing higher, speed naturally wants to decrease.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchUp3": "As you level back out, let's talk about another control: the Rudders at your feet.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchUp3_MALE": "As you level back out, let's start talking about another control: the Rudders at your feet.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchUp5": "Give 'em a try, and watch the plane's nose skew to either side.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchUp5Reminder": "Use the rudder to skew the plane's nose.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchUp5Reminder_MALE": "Use the rudder to skew the plane's nose.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlanePitchUp5_MALE": "Let's see you put them to use. Try to skew the aircraft's nose to either side.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneStraight1": "Okay, the last thing we're gonna cover now is the Throttle.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneStraight1_MALE": "Alright. We have one more control to cover today: your Throttle.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneStraight2": "If you have the need for speed, then the Throttle's for you. Full control over the power output of the engine...",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneStraight2_MALE": "Simply put, your Throttle controls the power output of the engine.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneStraight3": "Let's see what happens when you cut all the power.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneStraight3Reminder": "Cut the power.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneStraight3Reminder_MALE": "Cut the power.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneStraight3_MALE": "Try cutting all the power and see what happens.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneThrottle1": "Surprise surprise. Our altitude is decreasing.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneThrottle1_MALE": "As you may have expected, without power your altitude decreases.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneThrottle2": "This might be a good time for a Piloting PSA: Always keep an eye on your surroundings -- because nobody likes a low-flying duck.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneThrottle2_MALE": "Lower altitude means increased vigilance. However you always want to keep an eye on your surroundings. Nobody likes surprises when they're flying.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneThrottle3": "Alright, let's go ahead and throttle back up.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneThrottle3Reminder": "Let's push the throttle to the maximum.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneThrottle3Reminder_MALE": "Let's push the throttle to the maximum.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneThrottle3_MALE": "Why don't you go ahead and throttle back up now.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneYaw1": "Simple enough, right?",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneYaw1_MALE": "Just like that.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneYaw2": "Rudder pedals control the aircraft's side-to-side movement, also known as Yaw. ",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneYaw2_MALE": "Rudder pedals control the aircraft's side-to-side movement, also known as Yaw.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneYaw3": "On the ground, those pedals are gonna steer the plane left or right; up here, they properly align us during turns. ",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneYaw3_MALE": "On the ground, those pedals help you steer the aircraft; in the air, they align you properly during turns.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneYaw4": "Before we go on, let's bring the plane back to straight-up flight. Make sure your dashboard is aligned three to four inches below the horizon for a cruise attitude. ",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_PlaneYaw4_MALE": "Now. Re-align the aircraft, making sure your dashboard is three to four inches below the horizon for a cruise attitude.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Quickview3": "This is red rock territory. Beautiful, isn't it?",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Quickview3_MALE": "These are ideal conditions to take in all Sedona has to offer.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll2": "The first control on our training list is the Yoke.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll2_MALE": "First up on our official training list is the Yoke.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3": "I still remember my first instructor saying 'the Yoke is like a steering wheel… almost.' Sure you can turn, but you can also pitch.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3_1": "For starters, it controls the Ailerons.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3_1_MALE": "Let's start with turns, though.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3_2": "And the Ailerons, they allow the plane to roll and bank into turns.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3_2_MALE": "The Yoke controls the Ailerons, which control aircraft roll and allow you to bank into turns.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll3_MALE": "Some people compare the Yoke to a steering wheel -- and while you can turn with it, you can also pitch.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll4": "Go ahead and try rolling to the right.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll4Reminder": "Don't be afraid. Try banking to the right.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll4Reminder_MALE": "Don't be afraid. Try banking to the right.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Roll4_MALE": "Try banking to the right.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollDone1": "Nice.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollDone1_MALE": "That'll work.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollDone5": "Now let's see you level back out.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollDone5_MALE": "Go ahead and level us back out.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight1": "Good.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight1_MALE": "Alright…",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight2": "Of course, the yoke also controls the Elevator.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight2_1": "And the Elevator affects the plane's pitch, right?",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight2_1_MALE": "The Yoke also controls your aircraft's Elevator, pitching you down if you push forward on the stick, up if you pull back.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight2_MALE": "Now let's talk about Pitch.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight3": "Pull back on the stick, the plane starts to climb. Give it a shot.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight3Reminder": "Pull gently on the stick to climb.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight3Reminder_MALE": "Pull gently on the stick to climb.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_RollStraight3_MALE": "Pull back and see how the aircraft starts to climb. ",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_SmartCam1": "See if you can spot the Sedona airport. The runway should be a pretty easy landmark to find.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_SmartCam1Reminder": "See if you can spot the airport.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_SmartCam1Reminder_MALE": "See if you can spot the airport.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_SmartCam1_MALE": "See if you can locate the airport down below. Look for the runway, it's hard to miss.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_SmartCam4": "There you go. Visual confirmation on the airport.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_SmartCam4_MALE": "That's an affirmative. We have visual confirmation on the airport…",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Speed_Altitude": "You could add more power…",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_Speed_Altitude_MALE": "You'd likely need to increase power to continue climbing…",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_UnexpectedLanding1": "Hmm, you weren't really supposed to land there.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_UnexpectedLanding1_MALE": "Alright… Not quite where you were supposed to land.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_UnexpectedLanding2": "It's well done, don't get me wrong… just not what was expected.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_UnexpectedLanding2_MALE": "It's not the end of the world, just unexpected.",
      "BasicControls.Dlg_UnexpectedLanding3": "At this point I think it's probably best if we start the lesson over.",
