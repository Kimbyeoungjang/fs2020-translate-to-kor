      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Altimeter": "To figure out your altitude, you always want to read the small needle first. That's how many thousands of feet up you are. Then on to the big needle for the hundreds.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Altimeter_MALE": "To calculate your Altitude, read the small needle first to find out how many thousands of feet up you are. Then read the big needle to figure out the hundreds.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Delegate1": "Thanks. I've got control now. Well done.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Delegate1_MALE": "Alright, I have control. Good job.",

      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_InstrumentCamera11": "But that's about to change. Take the stick when you're ready.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_InstrumentCamera11_MALE": "But not for long. Take the stick when you're ready.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_InstrumentCamera1_MALE": "First up, your Attitude Indicator.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_InstrumentCamera2": "As the name implies, it shows your current Attitude. The white line is the horizon, with the sky above and the ground below.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_InstrumentCamera2_MALE": "This shows your current Attitude. The white line is the horizon, and as you'd expect, the sky is above and the ground below.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_InstrumentCamera3": "That orange element in the middle, aligned with the horizon, that's your plane.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_InstrumentCamera3_MALE": "That orange element in the middle is your aircraft aligned with the horizon.",

      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_InstrumentCamera9": "Now, last but not least, check your Altimeter...",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_InstrumentCamera9_MALE": "And last but not least, your Altimeter...",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Intro1": "In order to fly, you definitely need to understand Attitudes. Not in the mental sense... though being a great pilot is a state of mind.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Intro1_MALE": "One of the most important aspects of flying is understanding Attitudes.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Intro2": "Today we're talking about Attitudes of flight -- how your plane is oriented, relative to the horizon.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Intro2_MALE": "This lesson will focus on the main Attitudes of flight -- your aircraft's orientation, relative to the horizon.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Intro3": "If you look outside, you can see the cockpit is just about 4 inches below the horizon line…",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Intro3_MALE": "Look outside. Notice how the cockpit is situated approximately 4 inches below the horizon line…",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Intro4": "We're flying straight, with a decent rate of speed... ",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Intro4_MALE": "You're flying straight, maintaining a decent rate of speed...",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Intro5": "This is the Cruise Attitude. Let's see how it reads on your instruments.",

      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Intro5Reminder_MALE": "Focus on the instruments then.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Intro5_MALE": "This is the Cruise Attitude. Check to see how it shows up on your instruments.",

      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_LearnDescentAttitude1_MALE": "With a nose-down Attitude, it's no surprise Altitude is decreasing and speed is on the rise.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_LearnDescentAttitude4": "Why don't you get us back to a Cruise Attitude and we'll hit the last part of our lesson.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_LearnDescentAttitude4Reminder": "Now, get back to a Cruise Attitude.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_LearnDescentAttitude4Reminder_MALE": "Now, get back to a Cruise Attitude.",

      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_OufOfBound": "You're exiting the Training airspace, you need to go back!",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_OufOfBound_MALE": "You've crossed out of the Training zone. Better get back in there.",

      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ReachAttitude2_MALE": "Check to see how it shows up on your Attitude Indicator and Tachometer.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ReachAttitude4": "According to your Altimeter, we're gaining Altitude.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ReachAttitude4_MALE": "On your Altimeter, you can see you're gaining altitude.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ReachAttitude5": "But we're losing airspeed, even at full throttle. Proving you can't avoid basic physics while making a climb.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ReachAttitude5_MALE": "However, you're losing airspeed, even at full throttle. Not a sustainable situation.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ReachAttitude6": "Okay, before we go on, let's get back to a Cruise Attitude. ",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ReachAttitude6_MALE": "Go ahead and bring the aircraft back to a Cruise Attitude.",

      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeAttitude1_MALE": "That's it. You're set up with the same attitude and power you had at the top of our lesson.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeAttitude3": "Next up is the Descent Attitude.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeAttitude3_MALE": "Time to move on to the Descent Attitude.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeAttitude4": "Start by reducing your RPMs to 1800…",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeAttitude4_MALE": "First step is adjusting your power -- reduce your RPMs to 1,800.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeAttitude5": "Then drop the plane's nose a bit further below the horizon.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeAttitude5Reminder": "Nose further below horizon & reduce RPMs to 1800.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeAttitude5Reminder_MALE": "Nose further below horizon & reduce RPMs to 1800.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeAttitude5_MALE": "Next you'll want to lower the aircraft's nose, just a little farther below the horizon.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeCruiseAttitude6": "There we go… Now that we know how to Cruise, Climb and Descend, let's talk about the Turn Attitude. ",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeCruiseAttitude6_MALE": "Alright, we've covered Cruise, Climb and Descent. Time to cover the Turn Attitudes.",

      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_ResumeCruiseAttitude7_MALE": "Gently move the Yoke left or right to start rolling the plane. ",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight1": "If you take a look outside, you can see how our attitude's changed. But you can also check your instruments for the details.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight1_MALE": "A quick look outside will show how your Attitude has changed. However, you can also check your instruments for the details.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight2": "As a general rule, you always want to keep your turns under 30 degrees.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight2_MALE": "As a general rule, you should always aim to keep your turns under 30 degrees.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight3": "At the top of your Attitude Indicator, there's a series of notches representing 10 degrees each. Use 'em to control your roll!",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight3_MALE": "On your Attitude Indicator, you'll find a series of notches along the top. Each notch represents 10 degrees.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight4": "Notice, the more you turn, the more you need to pull back on the yoke to maintain altitude. When you're rolling out, you'll need do the opposite: roll and push at the same time.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight4_MALE": "You may notice, the more you turn, the more you need to pull back on the yoke to maintain altitude. When you're rolling out, you'll need do the opposite: roll and push at the same time.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight5": "The more you know about the main attitudes of flight, the closer you get to that 'Pilot State of Mind.' So keep practicing -- and whenever you're done, pass me the controls.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight5Reminder": "When you're done, pass the controls to me.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight5Reminder_MALE": "When you're done, pass the controls to me.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_RollLeftRight5_MALE": "Mastering the main Attitudes of flight is an essential step for every pilot in training. You're on your way, but more practice never hurts. Whenever you're done, pass me the controls.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Stall1": "Make sure you don't pitch-up too much, or the angle will be too steep to create lift -- and without enough lift, we'll stall.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_Stall1_MALE": "You don't want to pitch-up too much. If the angle's too steep, it won't create lift. Without enough lift, the aircraft will stall.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_TakeControls1": "Pull back slightly on the Yoke to raise the nose just above the horizon line... about 2 inches.",
      "BasicInstruments.Dlg_TakeControls1_MALE": "Pull back slightly on the yoke, raising the nose approximately 2 inches above the horizon line.",
